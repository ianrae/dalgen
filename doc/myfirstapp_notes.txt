I find it very hard to remember Angular. I am not a full time developer. I manage a team. I also do some development from time to time. I learned Angular 

and used it a bit. When I came back to it a few weeks later, I found that I didn't recall how to work with it and I had to lookup almost anything I want 

to do. On the other hand, I don't have the same issue with knockout. Having said that, I have used knockout for much longer and that most likely is part 

of the reason (Although, I am not convinced it is the only reason). For knockout, I I plan to use DurandalJS in the future, but haven't yet.

JAVA HASHMAP
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html
-is thread-safe for read-only operations
" If multiple threads access a hash map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally."

JAVA GENERICS
http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/04/java-generics-quick-tutorial.html
List<Apple> apples = new ArrayList<Apple>();
List<? extends Fruit> fruits = apples;
void eat(List<? extends Fruit> fruits); //will process any type of fruit

CreateReply r = boundary.process(new cmd)

JPA ASSOCIATIONS - Relationships
http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnbqa.html

-simple list is list of non-entities, such as strings
@Entity
public class Person {
    ...
    @ElementCollection(fetch=EAGER)
    protected Set<String> nickname = new HashSet();
    ...
}

-one-to-one  (Husband <-> Wife)
-one-to-many (Coach <-> Players)
-many-to-one (Appartments <-> Landlord)
-many-to-many (Profs <-> Students)

-assocs can be uni-directional. is an "owning" side; (owning side writes the assoc to db and has the foreign key)
-assocs can be bi-directional. is an "owning" side and an "invserse" side
-can specify cascading deletes

-note. jpa Embedded objects allow you to define a class like a C Struct and then use it in many entities.
Embedded objects have no Id -- they are always included inside another object.

http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-01-2008/jw-01-jpa2.html
Customer
Orders .custId
OrderInvoice .orderId
Products
OrderDetail .orderId, .prodId

OrderInvoice
  @Column(name = "ORDER_ID")
  private long orderId;

  @OneToOne(optional=false)  //optional false means inner join (intersection)
  @JoinColumn(name = "ORDER_ID") 
  private Order order;       

-optional=false when both sides MUST exist.
-optional=true when related object may not exist

  Order invoice.getOrder() does query and returns object

-so this is a uni-directional relationship.  Order has no way to get its invoice.

-to make it bi-directional, add this to Order. targetEntity is the "owning" class in the relationship
  @OneToOne(optional=false,cascade=CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy="order",targetEntity=Invoice.class)
  private Invoice invoice;    
-so do Invoice order.GetInvoice() which does a query to find Invoice where .orderId==this.id

PLAY EBEAN assoc
Computer many-to-one with Company. (Company means company that built the computer)
Computer has this:
 @ManyToOne
 public Company company;
-means each computer has one company, but one company can build many computers
-db tbl: computer has company_id

-and the main query includes
 .fetch("company")  //which means include my company object

-then company has no ref to computer
-but does expose Map<String,String> options() that gets a list of all companies <id,name>
 that can be used in forms

 @select(
                computerForm("company.id"), 
                options(Company.options), 
                '_label -> "Company", '_default -> "-- Choose a company --",
                '_showConstraints -> false
            )

-since MEF uses modelforms, we don't have to do anything. options(CompanyModel.options)
-DALGEN
<field>@Id Long id</field>
<field>@ManyToOne Company company</field>  --this is an assoc!
-and company can do
<getmap key="id", value="name">options</getlist> 

-view of Computer has to handle .company may be null
@if(computer.company == null) { <em>-</em> } else { @computer.company.name }

DB LOGGING

-2.sql does it!
 -not idemptent though. only works if db is empty when runs

PLAY PLUGINS
http://www.objectify.be/wordpress/?tag=play
-create a class. onStart,onStop,enabled
-add to conf/play.plugins file

PLAY MODULES
http://www.objectify.be/wordpress/?p=363
-a mini-app
-mymodel
  samples
  project-code -which has app,conf, etc
  app.conf -keep it but it should be empty. (module config should go in app conf file)
  routes - DELETE it!
  -then create a single class MyLogger (no parent class needed)
  -done. publish to local repo

-now in an app that wants to use the module, add it to build.scala


 I’m just too damn old to learn these shiny new things.

RALLY DISCUSSION GROUPS
-has Notifications feature
 -can enable rules for sending notifications
 -in-app you have a notification viewer
 -also is email and RSS notification
  -email doesn't allow you to reply though
  -all input must be in-app

PHONE to USER
   private PhoneModel phone;    
    
    public Phone getPhone() {
    	if (phone == null)
    	{
    		return null;

    	Phone entity = PhoneDAL.createEntityFromModel(phone);

		this.phone = val;
    	Phone entity = PhoneDAL.createEntityFromModel(phone);
        this.entity.phone = entity;
    }

TO DO
-get extend working in dalgen so don't overwrite user.validate
-get phone added and working with dalgen
-work on OneToOne assoc
 -change createEntityToModel to handle null -dalgen
-dalgen: DAL findById should include .fetch("phone") and all()
-dalgen: support <getmap key="id", value="name">options</getlist> 
-add 2.sql that seeds db

END OF SATURDAY
-making really good progress
-overall tasks are:
 install - github, out-of-box-experience with zip
 docs
 using in a project - codegen for scaffold and dal
 
 code quality 
   -remove _ctx
   -make play module, etc
   
 featues - better query? better unit testing? ?

JSON
f you're inheriting from the Model class (as you should), it provides a save() method as well as an ID attribute. When you call save() on an object you got out of the database, it will be updated, and if you call it on a new object it will be saved to the database. It's all automagical!

Phone ph = new PHone... 
save()

user u1 = new User(...)
..us.phone = ph
dal.save

added EntityLoader and mef/conf/user-json1.txt

RUNNING INTEGRATION TESTS
-i would like to use fake application for 
 -testing real dals
 -view rendering tests
 
Keep getting ebean errors. Ebean works fine when run app, just not when run junit tests with fakeapplication.
set Run Configurations vm setting:
-javaagent:lib/avaje-ebeanorm-agent.jar=debug=3;packages=models.*

-get lots of debug info
-doesn't like accessing this.entiy. inside setters!
